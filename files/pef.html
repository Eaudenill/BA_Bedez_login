				<p>In 1965, the famous Filipino scientist Dr. Dioscoro Rabor warned the world that this bird was endangered. Neglected by most of his countrymen, he was able to enlist the support of the famous aviator Charles A. Lindbergh. In 1969 the Monkey-Eating Eagle Conservation Program was established. </p>
				<br>

				<p>With the death of Charles Lindbergh, interest in continuing the program quickly faded. During this time, Eagle's work was maintained by the initiative of Peace Corps volunteers in collaboration with the Philippine government's Parks and Wildlife Service. </p>
				<br>

				<p>In 1977, one of his Peace Corps volunteers, Robert S. Kennedy, returned to the Philippines to continue his research on the eagle. He also successfully lobbied the presidential office to change the name of the species from the monkey-eating eagle to its current name, the Philippine eagle. </p>
				<br>

				<p>The dedication and effort put into this work has finally paid off. In 1992, the Foundation successfully produced his first two Philippine Eagles bred and hatched in captivity. The birth of Pag-asa (Hope) and Pagkakaisa (Unity) caught the attention of the world and ultimately led to a wave of public support and sympathy that helped galvanize efforts to save the species. </p>
				<br>

				<p>The Foundation takes a holistic approach to conservation, conducting research, on-site and off-site conservation, and community-based initiatives to advance understanding and achieve results in the conservation of eagles and their species' habitats, and working on general education. </p>
